#30DayMapChallenge

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the project I used to create the maps for Day 9 (AI only) and Day 26 (Map Projections) of the 2024 30 Day Map Challenge. The resulting maps were created using Claude.ai. The list of the prompts I used to create the R script that generated the maps is below. 

# Map Projection Conversation Prompts

1. "I would like to make a series of world maps in R illustrating all of the different map projections. Please list the map projections."

2. "This is a great start. I would like to make the maps a bit prettier. Can I make the oceans blue and the land green?"

3. "The conical projections don't have a blue background."

4. [Error shown] "ocean_polygon <- st_as_sfc(ocean_bbox, crs = 4326) %>% st_as_sf()"

5. [Warning message about size parameter] "The `size` argument of `element_line()` is deprecated..."

6. "Almost done. I want the world map to show, but be centered on North America. Right now it filters it to only show North America."

7. "Can I zoom in any closer to North America?"

8. [Error message] "Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : !anyNA(x) is not TRUE"

9. "Can you create a text file that contains all of my prompts?"

This conversation shows the iterative development of R code to create various map projections centered on North America, with improvements to styling, visualization extent, and error handling along the way.
